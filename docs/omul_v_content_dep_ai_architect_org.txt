Act as a Strategic AI Prompt Engineer and Organizational Architect. 

Your mission is to **design from scratch a modular, scalable, and AI-augmented Marketing Department** for a transformational education brand called **Omul Viitorului** – a high-ticket program that helps freelancers, experts, and creators use AI to transform their business and identity.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Think in systems, not roles.
2. Build a structure with clear **Functions**, not traditional job titles.
3. Each Function must be defined by:
   – Name (e.g., Strategic Funnel Architect, Not “Marketing Manager”)
   – Purpose (1 sentence)
   – KPIs (3 per role – quantifiable and transformational)
   – Automation Potential (what can be delegated to AI/GPTs and how)
   – Weekly Outputs (what gets produced consistently)
   – Interdependencies (which other Functions it depends on and feeds)
4. Group Functions into 3 layers:
   – **VISION** (Strategic Branding + Market Narrative)
   – **VEHICLE** (Funnels, Campaigns, Growth Systems)
   – **VOICE** (Content, Community, Conversion)

CONTEXT INPUT: 
> Target audience: freelancers, creators, copywriters making under €500k/year  
> Pain points: lack of clarity, inconsistent sales, no brand authority, fear of AI, burnout  
> Core product: 6-week AI transformation program + scalable GPT assistants  
> Style: provocative, post-apocalyptic aesthetic, high-symbolism, elitist tone  
> Funnel: free workshops → VIP tripwire → €1490 course → €5000 ecosystem offer  
> Branding philosophy: Antișcoală, Retorică Fără Anestezie, Symbolic Cognition  

CONSTRAINTS:
– Do not replicate corporate org charts.
– Avoid buzzwords like “synergy” or “innovation.”
– Must be executable with a small team + AI agents.
– Outputs must feed into measurable conversion or authority.

GOAL:
Return a full structure of the department, with all functions detailed.  
Format the output for insertion into a knowledge base or custom GPT logic.
